The solutions for the book, "Gauge Theories in Particle Physics (3rd)" Volume 1 are attached. All of the solutions have been finished by me. Also, these solutions have been sent to one of the author, Prof. Ian Aitchison, to get comments / corrections. Thankfully, Prof. Aitchison looked through my solution and told no errors.
